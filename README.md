# NOT homeless 
A quick project to parse houses ads


## How to

To run this project you need to run both the client and the server.
First clone the project, then open two terminals: 
- Terminal 1:
```
cd not-homeless/client
npm install
npm start
```

- Terminal 2:
```
cd not-homeless/client
npm install
npm start
```

Then connect to the website on `http://localhost:3000`

## Todos (not ordered by urgency and importance)
- [ ] Add some website houses (e.g. casa.it)
- [ ] Fix the configure json section
- [ ] Refactor all the code, it kinda sucks right now
- [ ] Host the client on github pages
- [ ] Find a way to bypass bot filter on some websites (like idealista.it)
- [ ] There is a little bit of space on the side of the page, fix it
- [ ] Add a distance calculator
